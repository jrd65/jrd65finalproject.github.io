  <h1>HTML Story</h1>
    <p>This is my project final for assignment titled: HTML Story. This project had the goal of  creating a website with the intention of an artist/storyteller. The requirements for this assignment were to have pages linked to one another, as well as images that align with the story.
  I really enjoyed this assignment as I was given lots of free range in regards to narrative(I love kitties!). I really like how consistent my style is for the page, as well as the easy navigation (i.e. nav bar). To make this better, I could definitely have implimented some more "art" aspects.</p>
