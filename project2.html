  <h1>Collage Series</h1>
  <p>This is my assignment final for assignment titled: I make net.art, not art on the net (Collage Series in the Browser). This was also a really fun assignment because there wasn't really any restrictions, you just make a collage and you're done.
  I added a lot of random other assignment jpegs, like the alien dog, and chili peppers. I also added some animal crossing gifs cause i love Bob from animal crossing. If I could change something about this assignment it would probably be to add more photos.</p>
