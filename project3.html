  <h1>p5.js Art</h1>
  <p>This page is a combination of two assignments. The alien in a spaceship is from an assignment titled:  Final Project P5 - Character. The other is from an assignment titled: P5 Self-Portrait. The goal of both of these assignments is pretty self explainatory, the P5- Character is creating a character, and the self portrait is just making a basic self portrait. I had most fun with the alien in a spaceship because one of the requirements was to make it animated, so I chose to have an animated character that loops. I chose the background based on the character. I think I did pretty well on both of these assignments, my only qualm was probably not adding enough details or other objects to add more onto the character/self-portrait. </p>
